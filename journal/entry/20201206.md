- Completed `Section 13. Understanding PostgreSQL Constraints` on https://www.postgresqltutorial.com. Great to finally have deeper undestanding of setting constraints of table for database level data checking. Also, learnt a lot more about Foreign keys which i thought i understood. Did'nt realise you can configure your child table records to automatically cleanup if the related parent record is removed via the `CASCADE` option (so useful!).
