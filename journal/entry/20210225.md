- Setting up another custom graphql express app from scratch. It's possible to add custom middleware using `graphql-middleware`. This lets us write functions that can called before every resolver. Example boilerplate for what custom graphql middleware looks like:
```js
export const log = async (
  resolver: any,
  parent: any,
  args: any,
  context: any,
  info: any
) => {
  if(!parent){
    console.log("Start Logging")
  }
  const result = await resolver(parent, args, context, info)
  console.log("finished call to resolver");
  return result
  
}
```
