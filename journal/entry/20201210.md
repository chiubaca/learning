- Completed `Section 17. PostgreSQL Recipes` which concludes the basics section at https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/. Good set of tips which I can refer back to, especial removing duplicates sections. `EXPLAIN` operation is fascinating, amazing that you postgres can break down the processes involved in a SQL operation, very useful for troubleshooting an inefficient script i suppose!
- Got side tracked looking at installing other procedual languages on posgres - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xplang-install.html . This has blown my mind that you can run other language for postgres functions, including Javascript!
