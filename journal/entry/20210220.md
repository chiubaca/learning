- Learnt about React Router for client side routing using the `<Switch>` and `<Route>` components. 
    - the `<Route>` can take a `path` prop which will dictate what component to show depending on the url path 
    - to show a component at spefic path use the `component` prop which takes a React component as it's input
       - if you want to provide a prop along with it too, you need wrap the component in a function like so:
       ```tsx
       function App() {
        const renderComponentWithProp = (props: any) => {
          console.log("screenC props", props)
          return <ScreenC {...props} message="This is some data"/>
        }

        return (
          <div className="App">
            <Switch>
              <Route path="/c/:userid" component={renderComponentWithProp} />
            </Switch>
          </div>
        );
      }
       ```
   - There are a bunch of additonal props availabe on your component when used withe the `<Route>` component such as `history`, `location` and `match`. This let you have programatic access to the react-router api. Alternatively you can tap into the react-router api using new hooks such as  `useHistor` and `useParams`.
