- Craftmanship beats Passion every time (according to so good they cant ignore you). Becoming "so good they can't ignore" can only happen when you have sunken enought time into the thing you you want be good at. This means whatever we do, we should opitmise our time which build upon this skill, also known as "Career Capital". If you job does optimise for you to grow your career capital, It's probably time to leave.
- Sometimes it's difficult to determine hard parts of your job is the "grind" to getting better or if it is genuinely just a bad job. a.k.a not optimising your career capital. Things to look out for:
    - Your job makes you work people you dont like
    - Your job has negative impact on the world (in your opinion)
    - Your job provides you little oppurtunity to optimise your skills that make you rare and valuable.
