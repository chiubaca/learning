- Playing around with vue composition API somemore today and built a working pomodoro timer https://fcc-frontend-challenges-vue.netlify.app/#/pomodoro. It's just functions and it's really nice to work with. I like it! Tailwind is also starting to grow on me. Not needing to come up with class name is actually really nice.
- Reading few more chapters of coding career tonight.
